Shuffling
1. Moving data around network ( groupByKey expensive )
2. Reduce by key reduces shuffling

Partitioning
1. Data within an RDD is split into several partitions

Properties of partitions
1. partitions never span multiple machines.
2. Each machine in the cluster contains one or more partitions
3, Number of partitions to use is configurable

Hash partitioning
hashcode % number of partitions

Range Partitioning
When keys have some sort of order, sorted ranges of key

partitionsBy => creates RDD with specific partitioner
